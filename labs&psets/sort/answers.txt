sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: The worst-case sorting time (n^2) is significantly greater than the best-case time (n), while the other two algorithms exhibit similar performance for each case.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: the sorting time is much shorter (n log n) compared to sort 3 (n^2).

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: the sorting time is much longer (n^2) compared to sort 2 (n log n).
