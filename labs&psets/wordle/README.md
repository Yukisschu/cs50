### Wordle Game in the Terminal

---
Wordle is a web-based word game created by Josh Wardle. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position.

If you are playing the Wordle game, provide additional input for the word length. For example:

 ```
./wordle 5
```

This indicates a word length of 5 characters. Adjust the number accordingly (e.g., `./wordle 6`, `./wordle 7`).
