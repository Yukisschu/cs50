### Identifies to Whom a Sequence of DNA Belongs

---

## DNA Background Knowledge
DNA is a sequence of nucleotides arranged in a double helix structure. Each nucleotide contains one of four bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T). Genetic diversity exists across the human population, with Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) being one source of variability.

## Short Tandem Repeats (STRs)

STRs are short sequences of DNA bases that repeat consecutively at specific locations. The number of repeats varies among individuals, contributing to genetic diversity. Using multiple STRs improves the accuracy of DNA profiling.

 This program takes a sequence of DNA and a CSV file containing STR counts for a list of individuals and then output to whom the DNA (most likely) belongs.
