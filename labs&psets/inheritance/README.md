### Simulate the Inheritance of Blood Types for Families

---
An introduction video about the background knowledge of blood types: [Why do blood types matter? - Natalie S. Hodge](https://www.youtube.com/embed/xfZhb6lmxjk).

A person’s blood type is determined by two alleles (i.e., different forms of a gene). The three possible alleles are A, B, and O, of which each person has two (possibly the same, possibly different). Each of a child’s parents randomly passes one of their two blood type alleles to their child. The possible blood type combinations, then, are: OO, OA, OB, AO, AA, AB, BO, BA, and BB.

This program creates a family of a specified generation size and assigns blood type alleles to each family member. The oldest generation will have alleles assigned randomly to them.
